 x Will need custom setup.sh script and makedist.pl, with /etc/webmin and
   /var/webmin changed to usermin

 x Authen::PAM needed for authentication

 x Turn on unixauth and localauth config options

 x Because we want to allow all users access with their normal password
   by default, unixauth will have to be set to some user who can
   see all modules..

 - In order to support per-user modules, a special variable pre-root
   will be needed

 x The global config variable 'userconfig' indicates to web-lib.pl that
   a per-user config directory is needed

 x /etc/usermin and usermin-0.xx directory permissions must allow
   reading by everyone

 x overlang entry in config file for extra lang entries

 x need user-selectable themes and language?

 x problem logging in after logging out?

 x switching of UID should be done in CGI scripts (in init_config or some
   other function), not in the webserver .. this way, some modules can
   choose not to give up root privileges!

 - Need webmin module for
	- Adding new usermin modules
	- Setting usermin module configs

 x Need nofeedbackcc and nofeedbackconfig entries in config

 x Need PAM service called 'webmin' (in RPM ?)
