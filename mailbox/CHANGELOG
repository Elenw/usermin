Added a link on the Manage Folders page for setting up automatic scheduled deletion of messages older than some number of days, or those that cause the mailbox to exceed some size.
Links to messages from the mail list now include a unique message ID, which ensures that changes to the mailbox (such as receiving new mail) between the time it is displayed and the time you click will not break the links.
Messages in the mail list can be selected by clicking on the subject, date or size, rather than just on the checkbox.

Added highlighting for selected messages (when supported by the theme).
